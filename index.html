                        and the rebuilt church, where his father served. During the Yugoslav Wars, several of 
                        the buildings were severely damaged by fire.
                        They were restored and reopened in 2006.[12]
                        Tesla's baptismal record, 28 June 1856<br>

                        Nikola Tesla was born an ethnic Serb in the village Smiljan,
                        Lika county, in the Austrian Empire (present day Croatia), 
                        on 10 July [O.S. 28 June] 1856.[13][14] His father, Milutin Tesla 
                        (1819–1879),[15] was an Eastern Orthodox priest.[16][17][18][19] Tesla's mother,
                        Đuka Tesla (née Mandić; 1822–1892), whose father was also an Orthodox priest,[20] had
                        a talent for making home craft tools and mechanical appliances and the ability to memorize Serbian epic poems.
                        Đuka had never received a formal education.<br>

                        Tesla credited his eidetic memory and creative abilities to his mother's genetics and influence.
                        Tesla's progenitors were from western Serbia, near Montenegro.<br>

                        Tesla was the fourth of five children. He had three sisters, Milka, 
                        Angelina and Marica, and an older brother named Dane, who was killed in a horse riding accident
                        when Tesla was aged five.[24] In 1861, Tesla attended primary school in Smiljan where he studied German,
                        arithmetic, and religion.[25] In 1862, the Tesla family moved to the nearby Gospić,
                        Lika where Tesla's father worked as parish priest. Nikola completed primary school, 
                        followed by middle school.[25] In 1870, Tesla moved far north to Karlovac
                        to attend high school at the Higher Real Gymnasium. The classes were held in German,
                        as it was a school within the Austro-Hungarian Military Frontier.<br>

                        Tesla's father, Milutin, was an Orthodox priest in the village of Smiljan
                        Tesla later wrote that he became interested in demonstrations of electricity by 
                        his physics professor.[28] Tesla noted that these demonstrations of this 
                        "mysterious phenomena" made him want "to know more of this wonderful force".
                        [29] Tesla was able to perform integral calculus in his head, which prompted 
                        his teachers to believe that he was cheating.[30] He finished a four-year term in three years,
                        graduating in 1873.<br>
